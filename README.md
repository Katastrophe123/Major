# This is a Computer Visison Project based Deep Learning Algorithm 
## Transformer-Based Computer Vision Project

A deep learning project leveraging Transformer architectures for advanced computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, or segmentation.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores the use of Transformer-based models, such as **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, **DETR**, or **Swin Transformer**, to improve performance and interpretability in computer vision tasks. The goal is to evaluate the model's effectiveness compared to traditional CNN-based approaches and assess its performance on benchmark datasets.

## ðŸš€ Features

- End-to-end Transformer-based vision pipeline.
- Preprocessing and augmentation using Albumentations.
- Support for transfer learning and fine-tuning.
- Visualization of attention maps.
- Performance tracking with TensorBoard and custom metrics.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The project uses the [Vision Transformer (ViT)](facebook/deit-base-patch16-224) architecture, which divides an image into patches and processes them similarly to tokens in NLP:
